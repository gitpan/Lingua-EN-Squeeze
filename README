    NAME

        Squeeze.pm - Shorten text to minimum syllables by using hash and vowel
        deletion rules.

    SYNOPSIS

            use Squeeze.pm;         # imnport only function
            use Squeeze qw( :ALL ); # function + variables
            use English;

            while (<>)
            {
                print SqueezeText $ARG;
            }

    DESCRIPTION

        Squeeze text (English) to most compact format possibly so that it
        is barely readable. You shold convert all text to lowercase for
        maximum compression, because optimisations have been designed
        mostly fr unpapitalised letters.

        Warning: Each line is processed multiple times, so prepare for slow
        conversion time'

        You can use this module eg to preprocess text before it is sent to
        electronic media that has maximum text size limit. For example
        Pagers have some arbitrary text size limit, say 200 characters,
        which you want to fill as much as possible. Alternatively you may
        have GSM Cellular phone wich is capable of receiving Short Messages
        (SMS), whose text limit is 160 characters. To your amusement, the
        description text of this paragraph has been converted below using
        this library's SqueezeText() function . See yourself if it's
        readable (Yes, it takes some time to get used to). The compress
        ratio is typically 30-40%

How to build this distribution

        You need Perl 5.003 or never. To install this module. Make
        sure you are in the directory that this README file is in and type:

            perl Makefile.PL        # to build the Makefile
            make test               # to test the module before installing
            make install            # to install the module

        After installation, you should be able to "man
        Lingua::EN::Squeeze" which will get you to usage information for
        the module. The man page should be placed somewhere like
        /usr/local/lib/perl5/man/man3/Lingua::EN::Squeeze.3 and if not
        you should be able to "pod2man Squeeze.pm > Squeeze.3" and
        then do "man ./Squeeze.3" to view the man page.
